        Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer sorting algorithm that:
        Divides the array into two halves
        Recursively sorts both halves
        Merges the sorted halves into one sorted array

        ⚙️ How It Works
        Example: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
        Step 1: Divide
        [38,27,43]   [3,9,82,10]
        Step 2: Divide Until Single Elements
        [38] [27] [43] [3] [9] [82] [10]
        Step 3: Merge & Sort
        [27,38] → [27,38,43]
        [3,9] → [3,9,10,82]
        Final → [3,9,10,27,38,43,82]

        ⏱ Time & Space Complexity
        Best Case: O(n log n), Average Case: O(n log n), Worst Case: O(n log n), Space Complexity: O(n)
